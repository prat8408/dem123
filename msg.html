    <h1>Happy Birthday, Miss 🎂🌹</h1>
    <p>
      I know I’ve made mistakes... I know I’ve hurt you in ways that maybe I can't undo 💔<br><br>
      And for that, I carry the weight of regret every single day. I may not be perfect, I may be stupid at times,
      and maybe even a fool in your eyes... but one thing I know for sure—my feelings for you are real, deep,
      and pure ❤️<br><br>
      There’s so much I want to say, so much I wish I could show you... but life has its own way of creating
      distances, and maybe I deserve that… maybe it’s all my Karma 🙏<br><br>
      Still, on this special day, I couldn’t stop myself from wishing you:<br>
      A very Happy Birthday 🎉🎈<br>
      May your life be filled with peace, happiness, and all the love in the world that you truly deserve ✨🕊️<br><br>
      I wanted to make this birthday extra special for you, but I messed up... and I'm really sorry for that 💧<br>
      If ever... even just for a second... your heart is open to forgiveness, I hope you’ll let me in again 🙇‍♂️<br><br>
      Until then, I’ll keep praying for your smile, your success, and your dreams 🌟<br>
      Because no matter where I am, a part of me will always care for you, miss you, and silently love you 🕊️💌<br><br>
      Take care, and once again… Happy Birthday, from the bottom of my heart 🎁💖
